# Instructions for setting up your development environment with Docker  

The files for setting up the docker environment in VSCode are locatted in the *.devcontainer* folder. The docker images for the cardano-node and the plutus dev. environment get pulled from the following DockerHub locations: 
* [cardano-node](https://hub.docker.com/r/inputoutput/cardano-node) 
* [plutus-environment](https://hub.docker.com/r/robertinoiog/kenya_course) 

In case you do not want to use a Docker integration inside VSCode editor you can use the Docker image directly. The *Dockerfile* and the *docker-compose-plutus.yml* files are located inside the *.devcontainer* folder. 

In any case you will need to install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). It is recomended to install and run Docker Desktop on your native OS. If you want to run Docker Desktop inside a Virtual Machine read through [these notes](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/vm-vdi/). 

The following instructions explain how to setup VSCode with Dcoker:
* Download and install VSCode from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
* You need to start the Docker Desktop application which will start the Docker daemon. 
* Open VSCode, click on the Manage icon in the bottom left corner and choose the Extensions option.

* After successfully installing the Remote Development extension, you will note that an **Uninstall** button appears in the extension description tab. 
* Close VSCode, clone this repository to your computer, then open VSCode and in the File menu click Open Folder. Select the folder you have cloned with Git. 
* When VS Code opens, the Remote Development extension will detect the Docker container. You'll see a message asking to reopen your project in the container on the bottom right side. Click the **Reopen in Container** button to build the docker container.

* You can click the Starting Dev Container message to view the log. The build may take some time. After a few minutes, you will see a message in the log saying *Start: Run in container*. This message indicates that the dev container is ready.

* You can safely close this terminal window by clicking the trash can icon in the upper right corner of the terminal window. Now, open a new terminal window in VS Code by clicking the **Terminal** menu and then **New Terminal**. 

From the new terminal window you can run and build Plutus projects. An example Plutus project is added to this repository. You can build the project with the following commands from the top location of the repository: 
```console
cabal update
cabal build all
```

You can then cd into the *onchain/* fodler and start the REPL with `cabal repl`.
